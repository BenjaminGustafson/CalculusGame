# 1. Introduction

- 1.1
- 1.2
- 1.3

## 1.2 Negative slopes
We now introduce that the zero is denoted by having an arrow.

Done:
4. -1
5. -2
6. -1 size 4 slider
TODO:
7.  2 size 4 slider

## 1.3 Fractional slopes
- 1/2
- 1/3
- 2/2

## 1.4 Negative fractional slopes

# 2. Multiple slopes

## 2.1

Done:
- -1, 1
- -3, -1, 1, 3

# 2.2 Grid sliders

Done:
- 1,2,-1,1

# 3. Approximate slopes

We don't want to have to only use slopes that align perfectly to the grid. In previous
sections, we have taught exactly how slope is calculated. (Further, slope is commonly 
taught in an algebra class, so it will be a familiar concept for many students.) 

TODO: Implement an approximate slider.

## 3.1 With guide arrow

A gentle introduction to the approximation. Just line up the arrow to the line.

No markers, just slope:
-  1
-  -1
- 3
- -1.5
With gridlines
- 1.5
- -0.8
- -2.2
- 1.9
- 0.1

Discussion: Might not need 5 puzzles here.
Also it seems weird to have the guide arrow here, but not elsewhere. Maybe its not even necessary here.
Or maybe it would be a good option to include in one of the first sets.
Remember we want easy problems and then harder ones at every set.

## 3.2 Without guide arrow

A bit harder, since we are now asking the player to make some sort of deduction
about where the slope is. E.g., it looks somewhere less than 3 but more than 2.5. 

Done: 
Todo:
- 2.5
- 6/8
- -5/4
- -3.1

# 4. Function fit

We take a break from slopes to introduce the function fit tool.

Discussion: We are very far along in the game and we haven't introduced calculus
yet. But, we actually aren't that far into the game: < 1hr. I think 30min of engaging
background puzzles is acceptable. Its more important to not scare the player off at 
the beginning than to not bore them. If the game is perceived as being about difficult
things, but is easy, maybe the player will feel smart. 

TODO:
Implement function drawing
