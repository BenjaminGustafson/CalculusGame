P: What were those last few puzzles about?
A: They were just showing you how to graph functions like f(x) = c and f(x) = ax+b.
A: Did you figure out what the two sliders do to the linear function?
P: One of them controls the slope of the line and the controls the y-intercept.
A: Yep. If the function is f(x) = ax+b, then the left slider controls a and the right controls b.
