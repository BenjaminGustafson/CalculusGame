A: Are you starting to see the pattern?
P: On puzzle 20, I saw that if f(x) = x,         then f'(x) = 1.
P: On 21, I saw that if f(x) = 2x, then f'(x) = 2.
P: On 22, I saw that if f(x) = x-1, then f'(x) = 1.
P: On 23, I saw that if f(x) = 0.5x+1,           then f'(x) = 0.5.
A: So, in general, if f(x) = ax+b, what is f'(x)? 
P: Hmm. f(x) = ax+b? Would it be f'(x) = a?
A: Correct! If you check your journal 🕮, you can find the rule there.
P: I know that in f(x) = ax + b, a is the slope of the line. Does that mean the derivative is just the slope?
A: You're on the right track. But not every f(x) is a line...
A: You've reached the end of Linear Planet. You can now travel to Quadratic Planet if you head back to the ship.
