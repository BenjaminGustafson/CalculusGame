TEXT
P: So, what does this mean? The slope of position is velocity?
A: Yes, velocity is just the change in position over time.
A: In fact, velocity is the derivative of position.
P: Derivative?
A: Yes, in all of these puzzles the graph on the right is the derivative of the graph on the left.
A: It will make more sense later.
A: For now, you just know that the derivative of f(x) is f'(x).
