A: Hi there!
P: Hello?
A: Have you figured out how these puzzles work?
P: Kind of. When you move of the red sliders up, the red line goes up.
A: And if you move it down?
P: The line goes down.
A: Hmm. So can you just set the sliders to match the square targets?
P: No, the slider doesn't set where the line ends up. It sets how much the line changes.

A: Exactly. If you need a review on what slope is, try puzzles A-D.
