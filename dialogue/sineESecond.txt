P: Okay, now the targets are back to matching the sliders, but there are 3 grids.
A: So, we are looking for a function whose second derivative is itself. Meaning f''(x) = f(x).
P: Wait, wouldn't it just be e^x? The derivative of e^x is e^x. So taking the derivative a second time you get e^x.
A: That's true, but there's also another solution. See if you can find it.
