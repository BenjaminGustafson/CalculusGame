TEXT
A: The function f(x) = ax + b is a line where a is the slope and b is the y-intercept. 
P: We just saw that if f(x) = -1.5x - 1 then f'(x) = -1.5.
P: It would have been the same if it was just f(x) = -1.5x.
P: Maybe the -1 doesn't matter? 
END
P: If f(x) = x then f'(x) = 1. And if f(x) = 0.5 then f'(x) = 0.5.
