TEXT
P: What happened? When I set the sliders, the line didn't go up as far as I thought it would.
A: Did you notice that there were twice as many sliders? There are two in every square.
P: Oh, I see. Each slider only sets the slope for half of a unit.
END
A: Yes. If you set the slope to 2 over 1/2 a unit, the line goes up 1.
