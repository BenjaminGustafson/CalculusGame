P: The targets were moving opposite to the sliders!
A: Right. The value of the target was set to the negative of the slider.
P: Why would we do that?
A: Remember on Exponential Planet we wanted to find a function that's derivative is itself. 
P: Sure, we wanted f'(x) = f(x).
A: Now we want to find a function that's derivative is the negative of itself.
A: Okay, so we want f'(x) = -f(x).
