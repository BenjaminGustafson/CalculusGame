A: Did you notice a pattern in those y-values? 
P: 1,2,4,8,16... The number doubles each time? 
A: Yes. It's powers of 2.
P: Why does that happen?
A: Well, the line starts at y=1, so you have to set the first slider (at x=0) to be 1.
A: Then the slope is 1, so at x=1 we are go up to 2. So we have to set the second slider to 2.
P: Okay. Then the slope is 2, so the line goes up from 2 to 4.
P: And then the slope is 4, so the line goes from 4 to 8. And so on. It adds itself each time.

P: Interesting. The targets are moving with the sliders now.
A: Yes. Each target matches exactly the value of the corresponding slider.

A: Just like we said. Its powers of 2.
A: 2^0=1, 2^1=2, 2^2=4, 2^3=8, and so on.

P: I didn't recognize the pattern in that one...
A: That's okay. Now we have sliders every 0.5 on the x. So its not as simple as before.
A: But the shape is still similar.
A: Now instead of doubling between each slider, we multiply by 1.5. 
P: It got a lot higher by x=4. Before we had y=16, and now it was like 28.
